Examples and exercises for Azure Security from Manning Books

This repository contains the source code for the examples and exercises contained in Azure Security from Manning Books. This repository is a template repository and if you'd like to follow along with the book you can make your own copy.

With the exception of chapter one, each chapter's examples are in their own directory. In certain chapters, some modules contain code snippets to be run as a program from the command line, importing other modules along the way. I encourage you to follow along in the book for more context!
